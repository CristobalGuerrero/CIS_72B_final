/* Styles in this stylesheet target items that occur only on one specific page. */

/* First 2 rules you see below should probably be left alone, but you can adjust as needed. */

table#calendar { 
	width: 98%;             /* change this table width as needed  */
	margin-left: auto;      /* auto left and right margins centers the table since it has a width */
	margin-right: auto;   
}

table#calendar td { 
	height:  4.75em;  /*  change this height for the calendar days as needed */
	width: 14%;       /*  Since there are 7 days a week, 7 * 14% = 98%, so either leave this alone, or tweak only slightly  */
}



/* 1. Events Page Calendar Styles: Create 5 or more calendar table related rules. These should not affect other tables!    
   ==============================  5 required areas to style: table heading, weekdays, date #'s, empty days, & events.      
                                   You can style the table itself too. Consider using backgrounds on some of these areas. */


.question{
	top:5px;

}

.answer{
	bottom: 3px;
	font-style:italic;
	font: 10px "Andale Mono", Courier, monospace;
} 


/* 2. FAQ Page Question & Answer Styles: Style questions differently from answers so questions are easier to find,    
   ====================================  question and answer pairs are grouped closer together vertically,          
                                         and as a result the whole section is more visually pleasing.               */





/* 3. Services Page Image Styles: Use images' class to give common border (use a border style other than "solid").      
   =============================  Use images' id's to float first image to the left and second image to the right and   
                                  to give margins on the inside edge of floated images to keep text away from images.  */

/* Miscellaneous Styles: For any other styles for a single page that does not fit the above categories.  
   ====================  Use only as needed. This section is optional and does not count for any points.    */
