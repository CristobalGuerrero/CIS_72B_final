<p id="intro">Here you'll find some frequently asked questions about our hotel. 
  We hope that you find it interesting and informative. These are the questions 
  that people call our front desk with most often.</p>

<p class="question">So how did the hotel idea come to be?</p>
<p class="answer">The idea for the hotel came when I was playing a game and I enjoyed the concept of the game. Therefore I decided to create the hotel with the games concept of Norse mythology.</p>  
  
<p class="question">What are the regular check out times and do I get charged extra for being late?</p>
<p class="answer">Normal check-out time is at 12pm to 3pm if extra time is needed please inform the front desk so that you are not charged extra.</p>

<p class="question">What are the thrilling events at The Asgard Inn</p>
<p class="answer">The Asgard Inn allows people who are staying every saturday for dragon training. These fearsome creatures
are kept as sparing partners in order to train for the day of Ragnarok. If a person staying does not want to fight such a fearsome creature
they are allowed to learn sparing tactics with swords, maces and bows.
</p>
<p class="question">Is that a natural hot spring or what?!</p>
<p class="answer">
Our hotel does not offer the accomodation of having a pool the only bodies of water are the natural hot springs for the spa.
We are sorry for any inconvenience's this may offer.
</p>

<p class="question">How do we get to the heaven's in our vehicle</p>
<p class="answer">If you are worthy enough to pass as well as having deep pockets you will be able to pass the bridge called
Bifröst. If you are able to cross that bridge with no assistance from an elf or a god then you will be able to stay with a discount.
If assistance is needed the full price of the stay will be required.
